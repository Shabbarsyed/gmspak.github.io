Johnson’s injury left him with patellofemoral osteoarthritis, which makes everyday tasks like bending down and even walking painful.</p><p>“I didn’t realize how debilitating it was going to be, but it just kept getting worse,” Johnson said. “I was faced with this dilemma of needing a joint replacement but being far too young to do that.”</p><p>Realizing there were no solutions for young people with patellofemoral osteoarthritis, Johnson started developing a knee brace designed to reduce strain on the joint. To do this, the brace has a tension system that removes up to 40 pounds from the knee, making everyday tasks much less painful.  </p><p>“It’s about 15 million people that benefit from [the brace], and the average pain reduction for that population is 60 percent,” Johnson said. “They can be more active, have a better quality of life and better overall health.” </p><p>When Icarus Medical received their grant from Virginia Catalyst, a non-profit fund focused on helping innovation in Virginia, Icarus Medical decided not only to invest in research at the University and at Virginia Commonwealth University, but also hired University student engineers. </p><p>“We are really impressed with the talent we have the opportunity to work with at U.Va. We have great aspirations for what this company can do and we’re always looking for partners within the University and within the community.” Johnson said.</p><p>Benjamin Scire, fourth-year Engineering student and one of the lead design engineers at Icarus, joined Icarus in its early stages in 2020 and helped develop the Ascender knee brace. Scire said he thinks the research grant will help take the company to the next level.</p><p>“We need to get the resources and engineers we need to keep improving the automation and making [the manufacturing] more efficient, so that we can make someone a perfectly fitting knee brace in no time at all,” Scire said. </p><p>Affordability and accessibility are major considerations for Icarus. The braces are free under most insurance plans and are able to be customized quickly from anywhere. Currently, Icarus is able to scan a patient’s knee from an iPhone app anywhere in the country then 3D print the custom brace.</p><p>“If you want to get a custom knee brace, it’s going to take at least a month to receive it, and we are already doing it in about a week and a half,”  Scire said. “We are going to be able to get that time lower and lower with the help from this grant.”</p><p>Zachary Kim, fourth-year Engineering student and mechanical engineer at Icarus, works on improving the Ascender and modeling the brace on patients.  Not only is the technology and tension systems within the brace new, the automation and degree of customization is too. </p><p>“We definitely want to keep pushing the envelope of innovation” Kim said. “Very few products on the market are custom fit to this level”.</p><p>Partnering with universities and using the grant gives Icarus the opportunity to continue innovating on a larger scale.</p><p>Evan Eckersley, chief operations officer at Icarus Medical, has been with Icarus since 2020. Eckersley is working on optimizing the automation and production of the knee brace, which the grant will accelerate. </p><p>“The first aim of the grant and working with U.Va. is to complete the design automation of the device, so that we can basically take that scan and then automatically 3D print the device without any human involvement, just for the purpose of cost effectiveness, so we get the most optimal device” Eckersley said.</p><p>Icarus Medical has partnered with the University and Virginia Commonwealth University to conduct research on innovation and automation. </p><p>“Universities are huge for us,” Scire said. “We’ve got a lot of really intelligent orthopedic doctors at U.Va. and VCU who are going to launch these clinical studies right away. Getting that kind of network of experts is one of the best parts about working with universities.”  </p><p>“We met some key people with a deep knowledge of things that we needed help with,” said Johnson. </p><p>The Charlottesville based startup looks to universities for more than research. Not only are the students playing important roles in the company, the student employees are gaining real work experience and seeing their hard work pay off on the patients they benefit.</p><p>“I feel like overall I&#8217;d become a much more well-rounded engineer and, I guess more ready for the workforce than I would have ever been in a corporate position,” Kim said. “Even though I am an undergraduate, I am applying the things I learned in the classroom into everyday life.” </p><p>Despite only being a few years old, the company has had critical innovative breakthroughs while working with universities and undergraduates.</p>					</div>

The startup launched its flagship product, The Ascender, in late 2020. The knee brace is designed to be a light-weight, external muscle tendon system that takes up to 40 pounds of body weight off the knee, allowing for greater mobility and significantly reducing pain. </p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">Icarus takes 3D scans of a person&#8217;s knee, making the brace fully custom to each individual. The brace is then made using a combination of design automation and rapid 3D-printing. Johnson said the Icarus team is working with researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University and The University of Virginia on the design automation piece to help scale the manufacturing process.</p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">&#8220;The grant is meant to facilitate research among biotech companies and Virginia universities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is helping us get the data we need to prove our device works and that it’s helpful and much more advanced than what’s currently on the market.&#8221;</p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">Johnson added, &#8220;With VCU we’ve been able to demonstrate some power and torque data that just hasn’t been seen before, and with UVA we’ve been able to help automate the process of designing these braces.&#8221;</p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">Prior to the grant, the startup raised $1 million, including $900,000 in equity funding and a $100,000 Commonwealth Commercialization Fund grant.

Johnson founded Charlottesville-based <a href="https://www.icarusmedical.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Icarus Medical</a> last year and is set to launch the Icarus brace on Oct. 1. Chief Sales Officer Joe Khalifa joined the team in June.</p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">The knee brace is designed to be a light-weight, external muscle tendon system that takes up to 50 pounds of body weight off the knee, allowing for greater mobility and significantly reducing pain. </p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">&#8220;When you bend down, it takes weight off your knee and springs you back up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It works really well for relieving knee pain for people with moderate to severe knee arthritis.&#8221;</p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">Johnson said he originally began designing the brace in 2015 for his own use after suffering a knee injury that prevented him from doing many of his favorite activities like hiking and snowboarding.</p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">&#8220;That’s when I realized my knee is done, and there was nothing else out there to help me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I love snowboarding and doing all kinds of active sports, so I started buying braces online and cutting them apart and putting in springs and hinges to make my own brace.&#8221;</p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">He realized last year that his brace design had legs, so to speak, and began working on 3-D printed prototypes, with the intent to produce the brace using an injection mold. He found that the 3-D versions were extremely durable.</p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">To ensure the braces are high-quality, Johnson said Icarus is investing $600,000 in a top-of-the-line 3-D printer that will produce braces customizable to each customer. To date, Icarus has raised $250,000 from angel investors and is working on another round of funding.</p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">&#8220;They were durable in a way I didn&#8217;t expect, so we decided to produce the braces using a 3-D printer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I really want it to look good and have that injection molded quality.&#8221;</p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">Johnson said when the full site and sales launch next month, customers will be able to use the Icarus phone app to scan their knee, ensuring the best fit possible. A custom brace will retail for about $1,395, and an &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; brace will cost about $999. Both are reimbursable by most medical insurance for up to $1,100, he said.</p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">&#8220;For me, it&#8217;s very simple: I cannot snowboard without this brace,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For some people, it&#8217;s simply mowing the lawn, playing tennis, hiking or just doing functional movements day-to-day.&#8221;</p><p class="article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content">Johnson added, &#8220;It very clearly has a spot on the shelf and is something people need. We&#8217;re trying to demonstrate that you can do that activity again, and it&#8217;s not going to hurt, and it&#8217;ll give you the stability you need.&#8221;</p>					</div>

Click <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/alumnus-aims-rescue-one-knee-pain-sufferer-time-custom-braces">here</a> for the original article.<br /><br />An old James Bond movie inspired the name of University of Virginia alumnus Dave Johnson’s new company, Icarus, so it only makes sense that Johnson’s first product looks – and sounds like – something the fictional character “Q” might have devised in his workshop.</p><p>Johnson, in Q-like fashion, calls his device the Icarus Ascender, which is classified as a “Tri-compartment unloader.”</p><p>Designed for people like himself who have little to no cartilage in their knees, Johnson believes his invention – which he has been developing through the Batten Institute at the Darden School of Business’ Catalyst Accelerator program – is a knee brace “game-changer.”</p><p>“Most knee braces are just providing stability and might put a little pressure on the knee one direction or the other,” Johnson said. “The Icarus brace is actually giving you assistance, so most of the pain goes away, if not all of it”</p><p>Johnson’s journey to starting his own medical apparatus company has been circuitous.</p><p>Raised by his parents on a dairy farm in Washington after his father sold his company that built hydraulic systems, Johnson graduated from Tulane University with a degree in chemical engineering in 2004 before earning a master’s degree in chemical engineering from UVA. He had worked for the Department of Defense in Charlottesville for 10 years prior to accepting a position as a chemical engineer in the Department of Homeland Security in 2015, where he still works today as a chemical weapons expert implementing a policy that regulates chemicals for their potential use as weapons. He also worked at the State Department from 2017 to 2018 on weapons of mass destruction non-proliferation issues. </p><p>But Johnson, 38, has always had an entrepreneurial spirit. His first start-up was a non-profit solar company, which he also called Icarus after the name of the solar satellite in the 2002 Bond flick, “Die Another Day.”</p><p>“I’ve always liked the word and the Greek mythology story behind it – so I just kept it,” Johnson said.</p>					</div>

				<p>It was after undergoing surgery in 2014 to alleviate knee pain that Johnson realized the severity of his cartilage damage, which stemmed from a high school football injury.</p><p>Johnson, an avid snowboarder, said he badly wanted to remain active and didn’t like the idea of waiting 30-odd years to undergo a knee replacement, so he decided to take matters into his own hands.</p><p>After being unable to find any knee braces to his liking, he began trying to create his own, first by loading springs into existing braces.</p><p>Almost immediately, Johnson knew he was onto something.</p><p>“There’s a huge vacuum for people who have cartilage damage,” he said. “People bounce around [from brace to brace] looking for a solution to the pain.”</p><p>Johnson came up with an idea to use the facial recognition camera on newer model iPhones – which take images in infrared – to capture photos of the knee, which, in turn, could help him design custom braces through proprietary software.</p><p>Another unique aspect of Johnson’s brace is the fact it weighs only 13 ounces and – with the turn of a knob on the side of the brace – can take up to 50 pounds of pressure off a knee.</p><p>“It makes your knee feel like you weigh a lot less than you actually do,” Johnson said. “My knee thinks I’m a 10-year-old and [that] I weigh half my weight.”</p><p>To demonstrate, the 6-foot-1, 200-pound Johnson put the brace on, then did a squat.</p><p>“Normally this would kill me,” he said, “but with this, there’s no pain at all. “I’m postponing a knee replacement surgery and still doing the activities I love. Millions of people quit skiing, traveling or playing sports because their knees hurt. We’re changing that.”</p>					</div>

				<p>Johnson said the only other brace he’s seen like his costs $2,400 and is big and clunky.</p><p>Johnson said he hasn’t locked down the price point for his brace, which is made of carbon fiber and has a patent pending, but he expects it will be significantly cheaper, despite already being lighter, more powerful and better customized than any competing products. Johnson said people who try his brace are “ecstatic and tickled.”</p><p>One such person is Tony LaBua. The owner of Chaps Ice Cream on Charlottesville’s Downtown Mall has had knee problems for years and was blown away by the brace.</p><p>“I was a little reluctant at first,” LaBua said last week as he served a customer, “but I put it on, sat up and was like, ‘Wow!’ I love it. It just takes the pressure off the part that hurts.”</p><p>Johnson said being socially conscious is one of his company’s foundations. To that end, he has already done pro bono work for Wounded Warriors and with a number of residents with knee problems in the Charlottesville community who have tested the brace.</p><p>Long-term, he said that work will continue. “If you don’t have insurance or don’t have the means, we will find a way to get you a brace,” he said.</p><p>Having funded Icarus personally since its inception in 2015, Johnson is starting to seek investors. Catalyst, the Darden program that provides early start-ups in Central Virginia nine months of workspace, funding and other resources, has been a godsend, Johnson said.</p><p>“It’s introduced me to people who can help with the company, who may want to work with us and who may want to invest in us,” he said. “It’s really helped educate me about the many facets of starting a company.”</p><p>Johnson said he has also benefitted from the mentorship and leadership of orthopedists, kinesiologists, engineers, and orthotic and prosthetic experts at UVA, including Dr. David Diduch, Dr. Shawn Russell, Dr. Joe Hart and Kevin King.</p><p>He may not be saving the world like James Bond, but through Icarus, Johnson believes he’s rescuing one knee pain sufferer at a time.</p><p>“When I worked for the government, it was very cool and I was doing awesome things – being creative on how to make sure bad things don’t happen,” he said.</p><p>“But I was always looking for something I was truly passionate about that makes a positive impact in people’s lives … This is a great feeling.”</p>					</div>

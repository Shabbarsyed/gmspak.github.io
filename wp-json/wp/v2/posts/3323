Johnson founded Charlottesville-based\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.icarusmedical.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Icarus Medical<\/a>\u00a0last year and is set to launch the Icarus brace on Oct. 1. Chief Sales Officer Joe Khalifa joined the team in June.<\/p><p class=\"article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content\">The knee brace is designed to be a light-weight, external muscle tendon system that takes up to 50 pounds of body weight off the knee, allowing for greater mobility and significantly reducing pain.\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content\">&#8220;When you bend down, it takes weight off your knee and springs you back up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It works really well for relieving knee pain for people with moderate to severe knee arthritis.&#8221;<\/p><p class=\"article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content\">Johnson said he originally began designing the brace in 2015 for his own use after suffering a knee injury that prevented him from doing many of his favorite activities like hiking and snowboarding.<\/p><p class=\"article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content\">&#8220;That\u2019s when I realized my knee is done, and there was nothing else out there to help me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I love snowboarding and doing all kinds of active sports, so I started buying braces online and cutting them apart and putting in springs and hinges to make my own brace.&#8221;<\/p><p class=\"article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content\">He realized last year that his brace design had legs, so to speak, and began working on 3-D printed prototypes, with the intent to produce the brace using an injection mold. He found that the 3-D versions were extremely durable.<\/p><p class=\"article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content\">To ensure the braces are high-quality, Johnson said Icarus is investing $600,000 in a top-of-the-line 3-D printer that will produce braces customizable to each customer. To date, Icarus has raised $250,000 from angel investors and is working on another round of funding.<\/p><p class=\"article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content\">&#8220;They were durable in a way I didn&#8217;t expect, so we decided to produce the braces using a 3-D printer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I really want it to look good and have that injection molded quality.&#8221;<\/p><p class=\"article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content\">Johnson said when the full site and sales launch next month, customers will be able to use the Icarus phone app to scan their knee, ensuring the best fit possible. A custom brace will retail for about $1,395, and an &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; brace will cost about $999. Both are reimbursable by most medical insurance for up to $1,100, he said.<\/p><p class=\"article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content\">&#8220;For me, it&#8217;s very simple: I cannot snowboard without this brace,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For some people, it&#8217;s simply mowing the lawn, playing tennis, hiking or just doing functional movements day-to-day.&#8221;<\/p><p class=\"article-content-item article-content-item--paragraph not-paywalled-content\">Johnson added, &#8220;It very clearly has a spot on the shelf and is something people need. We&#8217;re trying to demonstrate that you can do that activity again, and it&#8217;s not going to hurt, and it&#8217;ll give you the stability you need.&#8221;<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Article first featured on Richmond Inno.
